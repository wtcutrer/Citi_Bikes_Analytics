# A Wheely Good Time - Citi Bike Analytics Yearly Trend Analysis from 2020

## Background
As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, I was responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In my new role, I was expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so my first task on the job was to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

The team decided to compound the data from 2020 in order to get a wider view of the data and better understand the trends by analyzing an entire year. We decided to start the analysis with 2020 so that the team can compare 2021 to 2020 in Janauary.

## Task 

My team was able to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find multipe unexpected phenomena and data. We then designed 7 visualizations to demonstrate the phenomena and specifically broke them down into Rider Demographics and Bike Station Analytics. The team also included a map of our stations around the city in order to better visualize our influence.  

### Rider Demographics

Key Terms
* Subscriber - riders that pay a montly subscription to our app
* Customers - riders who are visiting the city and pay one time fees to use our bikes

This is how our riders are broken down by Age, Gender, and Membership! As you can see the majority of our riders are 53-56 year old Male subscribers. This information is key to our advertising department. 

This data leads us to several key problems that we need to brainstorm: 
* Increasing the number of female riders
* Increasing the number of younger riders (i.e. younger demographics such as 20-30 year olds)
* Making our services more user friendly for the customers who are visiting or thinking of subscribing to our service

### Station Demographics 

These are the stations that are used the most with our rider base as well as the most frequent times that our riders are active. Our most active station is Grove St Path with the most popular start time and end time as 1800 (6 p.m). We can use this information 

We can use this information to better serve our riders and meet their needs such as: 
* Becoming more efficient at the redistribution of our bikes to different areas of the city from the most popular stations
* Setting the best times to redistribute the bikes. By this data it would be between 0400 to 0600 before the morning rush hour starts off. 

### City Map

Here is a layout of the map of stations that are used on a daily basis. This map gives us an idea of how our stations are spread throughout the city and where we should try to place new stations. 

## Future Research
Our next plan is to take each month of 2021 and analyze the data from those months for the past 5 years (i.e. July of 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017). This will be the next project of our team. Please enjoy this meme and feel free to ask any questions!
